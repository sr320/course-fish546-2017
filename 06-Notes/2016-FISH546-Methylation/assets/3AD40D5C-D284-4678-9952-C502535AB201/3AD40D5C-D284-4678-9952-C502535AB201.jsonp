Another way to consider this is that in species that experience a diverse range of environmental conditions, processes have evolved to increase the number of potential phenotypes in a population in order to improve the chances for an individual’s survival. This would be particularly important for estuarine species such as C. gigas, where a large number of planktonic larvae are dispersed by currents and can settle in a range of habitats. Germline methylation of genes essential for normal biological function, such as those involved in DNA and protein metabolism, essentially “protects” these genes from the inherent genome wide plasticity, as this would likely be lethal. Thus, as a result of their low methylation status, those genes involved in responding to environmental perturbation may be subject to one of several transcriptional opportunities.","targetRectangle":{"y":897,"x":265,"width":539.94140625,"height":294}}],"baseLayer":{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"objectID":"0","layers":[{"animations":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,-0.0004922987690640373,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":251658240,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"layers":[{"animations":[],"layers":[],"initialState":{"affineTransform":[1,0,0,1,0,0],"masksToBounds":false,"rotation":0,"scale":1,"position":{"pointX":512,"pointY":384},"width":1024,"sublayerTransform":[1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1],"contentsRect":{"y":0,"x":0,"width":1,"height":1},"opacity":1,"edgeAntialiasingMask":0,"height":768,"hidden":false,"anchorPoint":{"pointX":0.5,"pointY":0.5}},"texture":"1B29F4D194EB9F48FFF10402A330EE77"}]}]}}]}} )
